There is no jupyter notebook for this project as it requires tf.app.run(). This command needs to run when main() is executed but since
jupyter notebook runs block by block, it can't call tf.app.run(). Also, tf.app.run() calls sys.exit() explicitly. Hence, it is not possible
to create a jupyter notenook for this. I have shown the demo through the command prompt. This stackoverflow link explains in details as to
why tf.app.run() cannot be executed in a notebook - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48390664/can-i-change-the-script-bellowtf-app-run
