- Entity Disambiguation with Web Links
- Andrew Chisholm and Ben Hachey. Published in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2015. <https://aclweb.org/anthology/Q15-1011>

## Original Code
<https://github.com/wikilinks/nel>

## Description
- Entity disambiguation with Wikipedia relies on structured information from redirect pages, article text, inter-article links, and categories. We explore whether web links can replace a curated encyclopaedia, obtaining entity prior, name, context, and coherence models from a corpus of web pages with links to Wiki-pedia. Experiments compare web link models to Wikipedia models on well-known CoNLL and TAC data sets.
