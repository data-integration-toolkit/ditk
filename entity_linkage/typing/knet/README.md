## Approach

Given a sentence which contains an entity mention and its context, model aims to predict the probability of each type for this entity mention. The sentence is a sequence of words s = {..., l2, l1, m1, m2, ..., r1, r2, …}. For each word, we use bold face to denote its corresponding word vector. For each entity mention, our model builds a feature **vector x** to infer the probability of each type by computing an entity type **vector y**.

It consists of 2 parts:

- **Sentence Encoder**
  - Our model transforms word vectors into representations for entity mention and context with neural networks
  - Entity mention representation of entity mention is simply computed by averaging the word vectors of entity mention words {m1, m2, m3, …}.
  - Context representation uses Bidirectional LSTM and attention mechanism to encode context representation. Word vectors of context words {..., l3, l2, l1} and {r1, r2, r3, ...} are fed into the LSTM, and context representation c is the weighted sum of the LSTM outputs.
- **Type Predictor**
  - The **type vector y** is computed from sentence vector x through a two-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Each entry of y indicates the predicted probability of the type for given entity mention.

 ## To Run

 1. Import the Module from main.py

      ```python
      from main import knet
      ```
    
 2. Create Instanse of the module

      ```python
      knet_instance = knet()
      ```

 3. First call read_dataset() and give all the files required to train in the given order
   - types
   - disamb_file
   - embedding.npy
   - glove
   - Context file for train
   - Entity file for train
   - Fbid for train
   - Label for train
   - Context file to validate
   - Entity file to validate
   - Fbid to validate
   - Label to validate

   ```python
        knet_instance.read_dataset([
          "data/types",
          "data/disamb_file",
          "data/embedding.npy",
          "data/glove.840B.300d.txt",
          "data/train_context.npy",
          "data/train_entity.npy",
          "data/train_fbid.npy",
          "data/train_label.npy",
          "data/valid_context.npy",
          "data/valid_entity.npy",
          "data/valid_fbid.npy",
        "data/valid_label.npy"
      ])
   ```

 4. Dataset information

    - To simply run get the sample files from following link:
      
      - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s59j28nl7mjDxcwhSUBLWn13_hnrLXqL
    - To run on full train data download files from this two links:
      - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6h-k2w_ppQ7ASd7wanYfkCfKp0tnSe0/view?usp=sharing
      - http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
    - **Note**: After extracting unzip all the compressed files in it

 5. To train run the following commands. If already trained you can skip this.

      ```python
      knet_instance.train(None)
      ```

 6. To predict on any sentence give path to file. And each line should contain text in following format:

    - **<start_pos>\t<end_pos>\t< sentence>\t<ground_truth (optional in this case)>**

    - Sample file can be found via this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UI_i4f5ueTN8-Inqg7FESGgSKNbN1ZFG/view?usp=sharing

      ```python
       results = knet_instance.predict(["data/entity_typing_test_input.txt"])
       print(results)
      ```

 7. Evaluate on provided dataset in the predict (step 6)

    - **Note**: In this case ground_truth must be present, 

      ```python
       precision, recall, f1_score = knet_instance.evaluate([])
       print("precision: {}\trecall: {}\tf1: {}".format(precision, recall, f1_score))
      ```
      
    - If ground truth was not given in predict give location of new file in the list
     ```python
    precision, recall, f1_score = knet_instance.evaluate(["data/new_file.txt"])
    print("precision: {}\trecall: {}\tf1: {}".format(precision, recall, f1_score))
     ```

## To Test

To use the input file, output file and test python file in folder [test](./test) to test
